# Changelog

## v0.18.0 — complete local workflow and explicit review policy

- Documented the one-request entry path across Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor ([#45](https://github.com/zheref/hatsu/pull/45)).
- Made first-run surface bootstrap transactional and safe around user-owned files, closing [#46](https://github.com/zheref/hatsu/issues/46) in [#47](https://github.com/zheref/hatsu/pull/47).
- Aligned authoring, verification, launch, discovery, regression, coverage, and UI evidence phases; adopted Nen 0.9 device extraction and closed [#48](https://github.com/zheref/hatsu/issues/48) and [#49](https://github.com/zheref/hatsu/issues/49) in [#50](https://github.com/zheref/hatsu/pull/50).
- Preserved canonical Hatsu/Akatsuki agent provenance while excluding model, runtime, surface, and session credits, closing [#51](https://github.com/zheref/hatsu/issues/51) in [#52](https://github.com/zheref/hatsu/pull/52).
- Adopted published Nen 0.10 and its explicit Copilot-only `review-round-only` readiness policy while retaining the maintainer's separate human merge decision ([#55](https://github.com/zheref/hatsu/pull/55)).

Nen 0.10 release: [zheref/nen v0.10.0](https://github.com/zheref/nen/releases/tag/v0.10.0).
